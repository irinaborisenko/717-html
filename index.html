    <h2>
        <p>BMW was on the brink of bankruptcy in the mid-1950s.</p>
        <p>Motorcycle production was declining. Luxury vehicles like the 503 and the 507 were so expensive to produce that BMW suffered losses on these models.</p>
        <p>BMW needed a new model /â€“ one that would not require a lot of development costs.</p> 
        <p>BMW found its solution at the 1954 Turin Car Show. At the Iso Rivolta booth, an Italian maker of refrigerators and mini cars, there was a three-wheeled car with a huge door (which looked surprisingly similar to a refrigerator door) in the front. It was called the Iso Isetta.</p>
        <p>The BMW delegation acquired the licensing rights for the Isetta and for the production equipment as well.</p>
